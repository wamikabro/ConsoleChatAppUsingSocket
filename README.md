# ConsoleChatAppUsingSocket
In this application we have used 2 libraries to implement our functionality.
1. java.io.*
2. java.net.*

To implement Sockets, we've used ready made libraries of Socket and ServerSocket. We've used BufferedReader and BufferedWriter to control the InputStream and OutputStream.
Scanner to get input from the user in console.

This application has 3 classes.
1. Server: To handle Server. 
2. ClientHanlder: To Handle clients by keeping the data of all the clients and showing information to everyone in the Broadcast.
3. Client: Client has methods to do conversation in the broadcast.

This programs is a basic and simple representation of how Chat Apps normally work. It is not real world program that takes care of the idea of Scalability, Security, 
and other crucial things in the development.

IT is fun to create these kind of programs during the development journey, and enjoy your time with friends and family (or with yourself alone).
